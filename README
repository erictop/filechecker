Overview
--------
Flat file checker Python script
   Program to validate the contents of a "flat" file.  It takes the file names
   and record layout specification from a configuration file that is either 
   specified as a parameter or just exists as fileconf.ini in the 
   current directory.

   Usage:
     fffchk.py [-h] [-i <input file>] [-r <report file>] [-c <config file>]


Configuration file
------------------
You can use the configuration file to specify the files to use for input,
output (report), and file attributes to be checked.

The configuration has a [file] section and [record] section.  The [file]
section has the file details, and the [record] section contains the 
record attributes to check.

    input = input file name
    report = output report file name

    delimiter = field delimiter character (default is comma)
    fields = number of fields the record must have (default is 1) 
    reqflds = a comma separated list of the fields that require a
              non-null value, the first field starts at 1
    length = character length of a record
